        <div class="post-abstract" >Visual-language grasping is a fundamental and challenging task in robotics manipulation and human-robot collaboration. However, previous approaches not only overlook fine-grained visual perception but also neglect the correlation between object attributes and candidate grasping detection. To this end, we propose a CLIP-driven attribute-aware network (CTNet) for robotic visual-language segmentation and grasping detection, enabling the robots to listen, perceive, and grasp in real-world applications. The listen stage leverages the pre-trained CLIP to understand and capture linguistic concepts. The perceive stage serves as mining object-orientated features and attributes (e.g. boundary and spatial location) as well as yielding the fine-grained segmentation mask. This stage can provide a prior constraint for grasping detection. The grasp stage aggregates the perceived attribute information to constrain and refine the spatial location and width of the grasping rectangle, facilitating the generation of a high-quality grasp pose. Lastly, we provide an extended large dataset refOCIDGrasp to train and test our method, resulting in a grasping accuracy of 97.76% and segmentation OIoU of 81.82%. The real-world robotic applications demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed approach.</div>

Given a natural language description of a desired object in the scene, a human is able to adeptly listen for the gist of the description and understand linguistic and visual concepts, then perceive and delimit the referred object, and ultimately grasp the target by factoring in the physical attribute such as shape, scale, and spatial location. This process is similarly applicable to robots.<br><img src="/LemonQC/EmbodiedGrasping.git/./images/Schematic.jpg" alt="listen-perceive-grasp paradigm"></p>

Given an image-query pair, we first employ listen module to understand and align visual and linguistic concepts. Then, the perceive module recursively extracts object-orientied features with visual attributes and generates the target mask corresponding to the description.
